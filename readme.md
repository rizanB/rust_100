# 100 days of rust!

This repository contains my code as I learn rust for 100 days.

- [x] day 1: variables, constants, ownership, vectors, macro, trait, struct, impl
- [x] day 2: loops, control flow, enums, binary search, hashmap, cli
- [x] day3: tests, doc comments, panic

plan: rust basics → dsa → ml from scratch

## rough idea
- [ ] rust basics: i/o, csv parsing, json handling, parallel programming, async/await, linear algebra, benchmarking/profiling tools

- [ ] dsa: matrix operations, blas-like functions, graph algorithms, optimization algo (grad descent variants)

- [ ] ml: perceptron with sigmoid, relu, gelu activation, mlp with backprop, cnn, rnn/lstm, gru, attention, transformer

- [ ] fun architectures: kan, autoenc variants

note_to_self: gaps to cover:
- [ ] Result<T,E>, Option<T>
- [ ] advanced error handling
- [ ] lifetimes & borrowing
- [ ] advanced traits and generics
- [ ] parallel programming with Rayon
- [ ] smart pointers (Box, Rc, Arc)
- [ ] interior mutability (RefCell, Mutex)
- [ ] zero-copy operations
- [ ] associated types
- [ ] higher-ranked trait bounds
- [ ] type level programming
- [ ] simd operations
- [ ] ffi to call C libraries 
- [ ] wasm compilation
- [ ] memory layout optimization
